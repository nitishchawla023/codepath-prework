* I envision creating an iOS app named "MindMingle," focusing on fostering collaborative creativity and idea generation. 
* Users can create mind maps, visually organizing their thoughts and ideas, and then share these mind maps with others for collaborative brainstorming.
* The app will incorporate real-time collaboration features, allowing team members to contribute, comment, and vote on ideas within the mind map.
* The goal is to provide a dynamic platform that seamlessly combines creative thinking and project planning.
